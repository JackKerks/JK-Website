	<p class="aboutme">Hello, My name is Jarkus Farkus. I am a professional skier from Whistler, B.C. I am a 3x olympic gold medalist and a 2x Xgames 
	gold medalist.c I love to ski, some say I was even born on skis because ever since day 1, I was a skier. I love to travel, siing is a 
	great way to travel and meet new people. I have skiied all over the world. For example, i have skied in Colorado, Italy, Austria, 
	France and of course my home mountain, Whistler. Skiing gives me the oportunity to travel the world as my job. I love making ski movies 
	with my friends and just chilling on the mountain. I've created this webpage to document some of the best places to ski in the world.
	To ski, you need the proper gear, so I have also found the best ski gear on the market. Enjoy, and remember to keep shredding.
